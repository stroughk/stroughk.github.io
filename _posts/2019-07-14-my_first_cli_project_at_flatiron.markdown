At the end of the Object-Oriented Ruby unit, we were required to create a new command-line interface data gem for Flatiron School’s Online Web Developer program. The objective of this Ruby gem was to provide a CLI to an external data source. What an exciting opportunity it was to put everything together we learned thus far and apply our knowledge into creating an actual program that we build from scratch!

    For a long time I was in a planning phase and could not decide which website I would like to use. The task of scraping a website using Nokogiri was overwhelming at first. I did not want to start building a program until I was confident that I landed on a scrapable site. I tested out a few sites that came to mind. I used Repl to play around with Nokogiri and try to parse and search for specific data on various sites. After a few tests, I decided to build my gem on a fairly easy site https://millercenter.org/president.

    I liked how I could easily select the whole block of presidents and then use Nokogiri to parse html and extract specific data about presidents’ names, inauguration and end of presidency dates. Thus, my new Ruby gem ‘US_Presidents’ was born!
