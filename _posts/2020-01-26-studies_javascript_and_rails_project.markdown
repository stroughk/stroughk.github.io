I am on my fourth project at Flatiron, and I’m amazed how far I have come from my first project that I created seven months ago! The project we had to create this time was a JavaScript and Rails Single Page Application (SPA) that uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS for the frontend while Ruby on Rails for the backend.
The frontend had to communicate with the database from the backend API. Everything we learned up until this point had to come together as a giant puzzle. 
For many days before the project week, I was searching for ideas on what I should create. I watched several videos from Flatiron former students demonstrating their flashy, well-organized applications. I wanted to create something practical that I can use myself and has a purpose. While I was watching the 4-part video tutorial from Cernan Bernardo, I had an idea! Wouldn’t it be great if I actually had a place where I can log all the programming topics I’m learning for quick reference?  I can create a page that lists the programming language, topic, and a brief description about it. 
For several days I worked on creating the basis for the program. I had only one problem. It was missing the association (one to many relationship) that was part of the requirement to pass the project. After consulting with my cohort Michael, we threw some ideas together for what I could add to the program without having to redo too much and meet the deadline. Finally, the idea came to me that I could add study objectives to each study. Once I added the association, I was struggling to make my code work again. That’s where the digging and researching brought me to the understanding that I was missing the serializer. Once I added the Serializer Class that had many objectives with the rest of the attributes, my program finally worked. I’m happy I was able to make the program work. I put my best forward and will continue to press ahead learning more new things so my future projects can have additional functionalities.
