We’ve heard it many times - yesterday’s sixty is today’s forty. What if I told you today’s forty is yesterday’s twenty? Of course, I’m speaking of age. Generation X, to which I belong, is truly one of the most adaptive, loyal and hardworking generations in the workforce. In addition to strong work ethic and great leadership skills, many of us did not only adapt to technology for common use but have become productive contributors to the continually evolving technology around us. We went from using cassette tapes and CD’s to learning several programming languages and developing new technological tools. I am part of this generation and am proud of it. 

So why did I choose to become a software engineer? My first answer would be because I thoroughly enjoy it. I have always loved working in Excel, creating formulas, pivot tables, and working with data. I have been the “go-to-person” at many jobs I worked at. I will eagerly help anyone that has questions about any Excel related question. I may not always have the answer but I will gladly research it. There came a time when I had to take a programming course at college. It was a C# course using Visual Studio. The very first time I printed the “Hello World” phrase on the console, I got hooked! I was looking forward to every lab assignment I had to create for this course. I learned all I could from the given textbook and did a Udemy course on top. I practiced many hours on my own creating simple applications that were functioning as I programmed them to. 

My second answer is there is a HUGE shortage of talented software engineers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Employment of software developers is projected to grow 24 percent from 2016 to 2026, much faster than the average for all occupations. Software developers will be needed to respond to an increased demand for computer software.”.  

My last answer to why I chose to become a software engineer would be that it pays well to be a software engineer. The median annual wage is just over $100,000. I have faith that the program in Flatiron will help me to achieve my goal within a year.
