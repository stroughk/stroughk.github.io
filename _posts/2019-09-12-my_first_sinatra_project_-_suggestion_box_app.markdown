As we advanced in our course to move from Flatiron’s LEARN IDE to a local environment using Visual Studio Code, I felt like a whole new world of programming was opened for me. I immediately began exploring on how to not only program using the terminal but connect my IDE to Github and  DB Browser for my SQLite databases. I was excited to hear that we will need to create our first web application using the MVC Sinatra application. We were also required to use ActiveRecord, multiple models, database, and user validation/authentication features. 
	At first, I had many different ideas come to mind but as I tried to express my ideas in code, they weren’t working as I imagined. I realized that I was still in the early stages of programming and should not try to fly before I can walk. I needed a simple yet efficient application that would be practical and meet the project requirements.
	Being a team leader at my job, I have this obsession about process improvement. I always look for ways to make things bigger and better for our team and the company as a whole. I remember I created a shoe box for our team and named it ‘Suggestion Box’ for employees to slide their suggestions in. It worked very well for our local employees. We were able to harvest many great ideas about process improvement over the years. However, it was not working too well for our remote employees. They would have to email me their suggestions and felt disconnected from the process. This is when the idea hit me, I could create a Suggestion Box Sinatra application where users can have many suggestions, and every suggestion belongs to a user! The formula matched the MVC Sinatra project requirements.
	After doing much research, watching tutorials, re-reading the lessons, and many hours of coding, my Sinatra Project was finally born. 
It has a welcome page that greets the user and offers them to sign up or sign in. Once a user sings up, they can log in, add suggestions, edit entries, delete their entries, view others suggestions and log out. They are not allowed to delete or edit other user’s suggestions, though. There are flash messages that pop up if the users enter incorrect information. The application includes some pictures of traditional ‘suggestion boxes’ as we have in the office and encourages users to express their ideas boldly. Users may choose to post suggestions with their names or anonymously. 
	Throughout this project I learned a tremendous amount of knowledge on coding. This was a very rewarding experience and I am looking forward to the next project that we will have to work on in a few weeks!
